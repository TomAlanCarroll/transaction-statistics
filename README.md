# Transaction Statistics

This backend service calculates and serves statistics of recent transaction amounts using an in-memory data store. It was built with [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) and [CQEngine](https://github.com/npgall/cqengine).

## How to Run
Run the following command if you already have Maven installed:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

If you don't have Maven and you are on a Unix based system use the wrapper: `mvnw`.
For Windows systems use `mvnw.cmd` instead.
